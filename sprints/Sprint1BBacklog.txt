//Sprint 1B Backlog.
July 10 to July 17


User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user, I want to recursively list all subdirectories using ls -R
b) As a user, I want to move files using the mv command
c) As a user, I want to copy files using the cp command
d) As a user, I want to download a file using the curl command
e) As a user, I want to be able to redirect the output of any command into a file instead of printing to the console
f) As a user, I want to re-execute a command from history using !num where num is the history number of the command
g) As a user, I want to find all lines from given files that matches a given regex
h) As a user, I want to find all lines from all files in given directories recursively that matches a given regex

Specific tasks to be accomplished:
0-0. Updated CRCcards
0-1. Maintain that all commands are working as intended
a-1. Update ls class so that it has the option flag -R which lists all subdirectories
a-2. Test the updated ls option flag
b-1. Make the file system able to delete a general file from a directory
b-2. Write code that allows the user to move from one general file to a new general file, or into a directory
b-3. Test the cp class
c-1. Implement clone() for general files
c-2. Write code that allows the user to copy one general file to a new general file, or into a directory
c-3. Test the mv class
d-1. Write code that allows the user to download a file from a url given
d-2. Test the curl class 
e-1. Update redirection method so that any command that has output can use it
e-2. Test the redirection method
f-1. Write code that allows user to re execute code using !num based on the number stored in history
f-2. Test command re-execution method
g-1. Write code to parse the argument to grep
g-2. Write code that allows the user to find lines matching a given regex from given files using grep REGEX PATH ...
g-3. Test this functionailty
h-1. Make the file system able to get all files recursively
h-2. Write code that allows the user to find lines matching a given regex from files in given directories recursively using grep -R REGEX PATH ...
h-3. Test this functionailty
