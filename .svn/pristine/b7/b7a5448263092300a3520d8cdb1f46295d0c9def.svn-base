What did I do last time?
	-Reviewed code for filesystem, cd, and pwd
What do I plan to do now?
	-create sprint backlog2 and work on those tasks
	-Update crc cards
	-communicate with the group on future tasks
Am I blocked on anything?
	-need everyone to be transparent
	-Couldn't implement some of my tasks since other people worked ahead, need to communicate better
	-Need to understand other people's implementation so need comments
