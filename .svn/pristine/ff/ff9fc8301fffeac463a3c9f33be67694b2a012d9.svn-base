What did I do last time?
-Worked on FileSystem, File, General, Directory
-Decided that WorkingDirectory was not needed
-Decided that RootDirectory was needed to be distinct from normal directories
-Wrote an instance variable for working directory

What do I plan to do now?
-Update the FileSystem structure after talking with teammates
-Test the FileSystem
-work on Pwd
-work on Cd
-update crc cards

Am I blocked on anything?
-Need to confer with teammates on what should be included in FileSystem
-Need the FileSystem to cooperate with the commands
