What did I do last time?
    - worked on JShell to continually take input
    - worked on error checker to check if command exists
    - worked on Console
    - worked on input parsing

What do I plan to do now?
    - test the input parsing code
    - include the working path in the shell prompt
    - work on the parser

Am I blocked on anything?
    - need a file system to print working directory in the shell prompt
