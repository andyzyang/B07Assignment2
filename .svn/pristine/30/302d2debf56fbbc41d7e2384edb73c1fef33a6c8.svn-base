What did I work on last time?
	- The skeleton of the Crc Cards
	- Started linking several classes
	- Added crc cards for directory stack

What I plan to do now
	- Attempt to finalize the number of classes
	- Create more base cases such as Input or Execution
	- Nearly complete collaborators of all classes

Am I blocked on anything
