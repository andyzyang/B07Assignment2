What did I do last time?
    - made JShell interact with the file system to get the working directory
    - include the working path in the shell prompt
    - add tree command

What do I plan to do now?
    - work on parsing user input for strings for the echo command
    - make directories recursively searchable

Am I blocked on anything?
    - need to parse paths from user input
