What did I work on last time?
	- Creating crccards for thew new commands
	- Finalization on crcCards
	- Implementation of !number should be done but might not be correct to the dot

What I plan to do now
	- Discuss with team !number, issues occur in recursion
	- Implment grep and other important commands

Am I blocked on anything
