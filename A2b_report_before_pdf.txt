Assignment 2B report:
-What design patterns have you used? And where in the assignment. Why did you
make use of these design patterns?

We used polymorphism in executables, specifically in Executable.java line 57-59,
where any executable have their own execution method. We did it this way because
if we fit every class's execution method all in one class then it would lead to
spaghetti code.

-If there was a significant change in your design from 2A to 2B, why was this?
Why did you carry out this design change? Why is your new design better now?
If you think, your design has made it easier to accommodate new customer
requirements, explain to us why this is so.
